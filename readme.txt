To set this up, create a blueprint class based on TileSpawner and drag it into the world (I don't know of a better way as of now)
And also create a blueprint class based on Tile. Then go into the Tile blueprint class and adjust the TriggerVolume Box Collision so it is the same size as the same
(The player needs to be be inside the trigger volume so the TileSpawner knows which tile they are in at all times
